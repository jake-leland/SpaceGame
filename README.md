SpaceGame
=========

A Galaga-esque arcade game.

*Note: this is a [Processing](http://processing.org) sketch requiring the [gifAnimation library](extrapixel.ch/processing/gifAnimation). The game was developed to be played with the Xbox Kinect using the [Simple-OpenNI libraries](http://code.google.com/p/simple-openni/), but it is possible to play without a Kinect.*

Run the sketch to begin the game. Everything should be self-explanatory.

If playing with a Kinect, your body controls the ship.
- To move the ship up, move towards the screen.
- To move the ship down, move away from the screen.
- To move the ship left, move left.
- To move the ship right, move right.
- To shoot, alternate the vertical movement of your hands. (i.e. when your left arm is up and your right arm is down, cross them by moving your left arm below your right.)
- To pause/unpause the game, move your hands close together, as if you are clapping.

If playing without a Kinect, your mouse and keyboard control the ship.
- To move the ship up, press the up arrow key.
- To move the ship down, press the down arrow key.
- To move the ship left, press the left arrow key.
- To move the ship right, press the right arrow key.
- To shoot, click the mouse.
- To pause/unpause the game, press space.
